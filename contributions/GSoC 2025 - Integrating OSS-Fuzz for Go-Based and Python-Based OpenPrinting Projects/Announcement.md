=====Integrating OSS-Fuzz for Go-Based and Python-Based OpenPrinting Projects=====

**Security-related project**

1 contributor medium-size (175 hours), Level of difficulty: Intermediate

OpenPrinting hosts many polyglot projects, which are developed not limited to languages of %%C/C++%%. We also host software written in languages like Python and Golang, which function as crucial printing APIs and often interface with %%C/C++%% libraries to deliver comprehensive printing services. The integration of multiple programming languages into our ecosystem underscores the necessity for a broad and inclusive testing approach. Given the diversity of development environments, it is crucial to extend the testing for these projects, specifically for integration of [[https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz|OSS-Fuzz]].

To this end, we plan to extend the capabilities of the existing OSS-Fuzz frameworks to include projects developed in languages other than %%C/C++%%. This initiative will target Python and Golang projects, ensuring that our fuzz testing encompasses the full spectrum of development environments within OpenPrinting.

**Project Goals for GSoC 2025:** The primary objective for this Google Summer of Code project is to integrate the polyglot projects in OpenPrinting into OSS-Fuzz framework and refine existing unit tests for these projects. The targeting projects include:
  * **Golang**
    * [[https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ipp-usb|ipp-usb]]
    * [[https://github.com/OpenPrinting/goipp|goipp]]
  * **Python**
    * [[https://github.com/OpenPrinting/pycups|pycups]]
    * [[https://github.com/OpenPrinting/pyppd|pyppd]]
 
**Contributor Responsibilities:**
  * **Evaluate and Improve Testing Approaches:** The contributor needs to understand existing testing strategies within the project and evaluate their effectiveness. Where there are gaps, particularly in areas that are under-tested, the contributor should develop and improve tests to cover these functionalities.
  * **Integrate Projects into OSS-Fuzz Workflow:** The contributor should also integrate these projects into OSS-Fuzz framework, following previous integrations for %%C/C++%% projects in OpenPrinting [[https://github.com/OpenPrinting/fuzzing|fuzzing]] repository with appropriate fuzzing corpus.
  * **Triage and Report Vulnerabilities:** The contributor should work closely with developers from OpenPrinting to identify and report any vulnerabilities that are discovered through the testing process.
