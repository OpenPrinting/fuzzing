=====System/Fuzz Testing of Printing Protocols=====

**Security-related project**

1 contributor full-size (350 hours), Level of difficulty: Hard

As OpenPrinting advances driverless printing services, the corresponding standardized printing protocols, such as the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), have become more and more important. The protocol is fundamental to achieving generalized printing services and thus requires rigorous security testing to prevent vulnerabilities.

Effective testing of printing protocols and Domain-specific languages (DSL) like IPP and PostScript demands precise input pairs and well-regulated testing environments/contexts. Given the complexity and technical specifications of these protocols, creating universal testing suites that can be applied across various platforms and languages is essential. Such suites will support the consistent functionality and specification adherence necessary for secure and efficient printing operations.

**Project Goals for GSoC 2025:** The primary objective for this Google Summer of Code project is to develop comprehensive testing suites designed for the printing protocols used in OpenPrinting projects (e.g., IPP). Specifically, the suites encompass: (1) unit tests and differential tests for IPP, detailing test inputs and expected outputs within the appropriate printing contexts, and (2) fuzzing enhanced by a custom validator to verify the correctness of outputs against the specifications. These suites will incorporate unified testing drivers and oracles (validated test input and output pairs) to ensure accurate and reliable results.

**Contributors are expected to achieve:**
  * Thoroughly understand and summarize the key aspects of printing protocols used in OpenPrinting, such as IPP and PostScript.
  * Develop tailored testing strategies for these protocols, referencing standards such as [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8011|RFC 8011]], and [[https://openprinting.github.io/cups/doc/spec-ipp.html|OpenPrinting's 17 IPP specifications]]
  * Implement high-quality unit tests, differential tests, and fuzzing drivers along with protocol-tailed testing oracles within OpenPrinting projects. Contributors will also be responsible for identifying any discrepancies or bugs, reporting them, and coordinating with developers to facilitate necessary fixes.

//The outputs of this project will not only serve as a valuable reference for generalizing testing across all OpenPrinting projects but also the documented progress can also lead to potential academic contributions, such as technical reports or research papers.//
